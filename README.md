Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 👨‍💻  
I'm mostly into backend stuff with **Python**, but I also like to mess around with a bit of JS and automation tools just for fun (or chaos, who knows).

---

## 🐍 Main Skill

**Python** is my languaje of choice.  
From building backend logic and tools to writing weird scripts that save me from doing boring stuff manually — if I can automate it, I probably will.

## 📂 Some of My Projects (a.k.a. stuff I built instead of sleeping)

- [**instagram-unfollower**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/instagram-unfollower)  
  A Python script to unfollow people. Not creepy, just efficient. 😅

- [**password-manager**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/password-manager-app)  
  A mini password manager made for fun (and not for real-life use... pls don't).

- [**voice-assistant**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/voice-assistant)  
  A basic voice assistant. Doesn’t make coffee (yet), but it talks.

- [**tools**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/tools)  
  Just a bunch of handy scripts I dont recomend at all. Call it wird stuff by Matias 🛠️

- [**my-web-page**](https://matias-web-page.onrender.com)  
  My personal site — built it myself, cried a bit in the process, but hey, it works.

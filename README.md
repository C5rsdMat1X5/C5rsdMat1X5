Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 👨‍💻  
I mostly do backend wizardry with **Python**, but sometimes I open JS files just to feel alive.  
Also dangerously into automation — because if something can be done in 10 hours of scripting instead of 2 minutes manually, I'll do it.

## 🐍 Main Skill

**Python** is my go-to tool for making machines do my bidding.  
From backend APIs to random scripts that make my life 3% easier, if it saves me a click, it's a win.

## 📂 Some of My Projects (a.k.a. stuff I built instead of sleeping)

- [**disaster-tracker**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/natural-disaster-tracker)  
  Tracks natural disasters on a map. Fires, quakes, chaos — all in one app 🌍🔥

- [**password-manager**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/password-manager-app)  
  A mini password manager made for fun (definitely not for real-life use... pls don't).

- [**voice-assistant**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/voice-assistant)  
  A basic voice assistant. Doesn’t make coffee (yet), but it talks.

- [**tools**](https://github.com/C5rsdMat1X5/tools)  
  Just a bunch of handy scripts I don’t recommend at all. Call it **weird stuff by Matias** 🛠️

- [**my-web-page**](https://matias-web-page.onrender.com)  
  My personal site — built it myself, cried a bit in the process, but hey, it works.
